- [ ] Save local filesystem view of old bundles, restore
- [x] Handle scanned files with rotation tags
- [x] Tutorial function

  - [x] font colour (red, blue)
  - [x] page numbering size
  - [x] consider: auto-detect content overlap?
- [ ] Log error messages

## Requested features requiring more thought

Good ideas which are complicated to implement

  - [ ] choose default or specific court
  - [ ] claim no, coversheet
  - [ ] specific rules
  - [ ] include claim number check for different tribunals
- [ ] Section-based page numbering for compatibility with Family court non-financial bundles
- [ ] sort files within sections in frontend (qol but requires custom sort behaviour)

## Long term at best

Features that may be impossble or cumbersome to develop without compromising on privacy or freedom

- [ ] OCR Documents (tesseract.js if not getTextContent())
- [ ] MS Word file handling
