## Prepare Your Documents

You'll need all your documents ready as PDFs on your computer (or whichever device you're using).

You can save time by naming the files with ther dates and document names, for example `1 October 2026 Particulars of Claim.pdf` or `Claim Form 01-10-2026`. The tool can pick up on most date formats, so don't worry about the exact date style.

## How many volumes do you need?

It's usually best not to make bundles more than 20MB in file size as the GSTAT website is currently only accepting documents with a single file max size of 20MBs. The tool will warn you for large file sizes, but the choice is up to you (though there is hard limit of 500MB).


If you have more than this, consider making two volumes. In a simple case, all the documents for a hearing can fit into one bundle, but it's common for trials to have many different bundles, especially in complex cases. These can be grouped into themes, like `A: Statements of Case` and `B: Evidence` for example. 

## Click 'Create Bundle' and Enter Bundle Details

On the Create Bundle page, start by entering your bundle information:

- **Bundle Title:** e.g., "Index"
- **Claim Number:** The court reference number
- **Case Name:** e.g., "Tata Motors Vs STO"

If the bundle contains sensitive information, click the `confidential` box. A "Confidential" notice will be added to the first page and the filename. 


## Choose your Documents and Review the Index

Click "Choose PDF documents" to select the files you want to include. Your documents stay on your computer—they are never uploaded anywhere.

The Tool will automatically extract dates from filenames where possible and suggest document titles, and create a template index for you to review and edit before the bundle is created. You can:

- **Reorder documents:** Drag documents up or down to change the order
- **Edit titles:** Titles will automatically be taken from the filename you saved the document with at first, but you can click on any title to edit it. 
- **Add dates:** Edit document dates if needed using the date picker 
- **Section breaks:** Optionally add section markers to group related documents together

## Create Bundle

Click "Create Bundle" and wait a few seconds while The tool processes everything on your device. When complete, your browser will open the finished PDF bundle.

The tool will create a professional-quality frontmatter index for you, and it'll also organise page numbering, bookmarks and hyperlinks.

## Advanced settings

If you want more control or aren't happy with the default settings, click "Advanced Settings" before creating the bundle. You can customise:

- **Font style:** Sans Serif (Arial style), Roman Serif (Times style), Monospaced (Typewriter-style), or Charter (Traditional English style)
- **Date format:** Different date styles (Abbreviated, British, American, etc)
- **Page numbering:** Various options. You can also add a prefix to each page number if you like e.g "Bundle A Page 1" instead of just "Page 1"
- **Printability:** By default, the will ensure that all documents start on a right-hand page, inserting blank pages if needed; this means that if you print your bundle then section dividers with tabs can placed between them. You can disable this if you prefer.
